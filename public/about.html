    <h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEER, COMPUTER SCIENTIST, WEB DESIGNER</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi, I am Daniel Wendelken, a third year Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati (Class of 2018). I was born and raised in Cincinnati. Growing up, I always had an interest in science, engineering, and technology. My childhood was filled with activities like lego building, watching science programs, and of course videogames. Toward the end of highschool I began to become increasingly interested in technology related disciplines but at the time was convinced I wanted to attend medical school. Thus, when college approached I decided to enter into the Biochemistry Undergraduate program. After two and a half years of Biochemistry, I decided that I wasn’t on the correct career path and took some time off school to identify what I really wanted to do. After some time I decided that something in the computing or technology field was more appropriate for my career choice. Since, I’ve had the opportunity to expand on what I had learned during high school and am enjoying my choice of major much more.</p>

      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Software Engineer / Summer and Winter Semester - 2015</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> At Kinetic Vision, I worked the 2015 Summer and Winter semesters of as a software engineer and team manager designing and producing several software suites and inhouse software. Kinetic Vision is an engineering consulting firm based in Cincinnati, Ohio. The first semester, I worked on a team maintaining and updating a software suite used by the medical industry to catagorize medical staple's quality. The software is propratory so I can not share visuals, but the device which delivers the staples is shown below.</p>

<p class="sectionContent"> I also had the opportunity to develop a solo project which analyzed accelerometer data and generated a report from it. &nbsp;At the end of the semester, I helped design and implement the beginning of a new software suite which generated 3D data for STL printers from a 2D input image. The second semester, I primarily worked on the aforementioned software suite. This semester included the first client software release, subsequent bug fixes and new feature development for the client. &nbsp;I acted as the head programmer, helping to lead the team on feature releases, managing of the git repo, and bug fixes.</p>

      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle"> Cincinnati Zoo</h2>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Gardner / January - August of 2013</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> My time at the Cincinnati Zoo was my introduction to the working world. I worked there during my transfer from the Biochemistry program to the Computer Science program. &nbsp;When I arrived they had just begun construction on the lion and plains portion of their new Africa exhibit. &nbsp;It was a giant mud pit with a lot of work needed from the horticulture team. &nbsp;Below is a visual, looking over the open plains exhibit, demonstrating the state it was in at the time I joined the team.</p>
      <img src="img/about/construction.png" width="700" height="345" alt=""/>
      <p class="sectionContent">As I joined mid-winter, the beginning of my time at the zoo was spent clearing paths, preparing seedlings to be planted and inventorying plants. &nbsp;Spring was mild that season and summer came in full force rather quickly. During summer, my mornings primarily consisted of watering the Africa exhibit. &nbsp;Afterwards, I would join a horticulture team and either landscape, plant, clean or inventory. &nbsp;It was a different experience every day. &nbsp;One of the more interesting  skills I learned was how to lay sod<strong> </strong>for the new exhibits. &nbsp;It was amazing how once laid it transformed an exhibit from dirt to something tangible. &nbsp;I unfortunately don't have any progress pictures of the exhibit but the image below is what it looked like as I was leaving. &nbsp;Thane in the picture above is standing about where the rock in the center of the image is in the photo below.</p>

      <p class="sectionContent">I really enjoyed my time at the Cincinnati Zoo. &nbsp;It was a great professional experience where I learned and worked with a lot of knowledgeable people. &nbsp;I gained a large collection of knowledge and experience that would be hard to obtain elsewhere.</p>
